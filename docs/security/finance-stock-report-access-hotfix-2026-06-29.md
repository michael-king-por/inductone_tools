# Finance Business Report Access Hotfix — 2026-06-29

## Trigger

Matt Speer reported that he could no longer access the ERPNext **Stock Balance**
and **Stock Ledger** reports after the permission hardening deployment. He uses
these reports monthly for inventory review. A broader candidate audit showed
the same report-level gap affected other finance/business audit reports.

## Root cause

The production hardening intentionally cleared Matt's broad `Super` Role Profile
and assigned the scoped `Finance Viewer` role.

`Finance Viewer` correctly has read/report/export/print/select access to the
underlying stock and audit DocTypes, including:

- `Item`
- `Stock Reconciliation`
- `Stock Ledger Entry`
- `Bin`
- `Warehouse`
- `Serial No`
- `Stock Entry`
- `Work Order`

However, ERPNext standard Script Reports have a second access gate on the
`Report` record itself. In candidate, before the hotfix, both reports allowed
only:

- `Stock User`
- `Accounts Manager`

That meant Matt could read the underlying stock data but Frappe blocked him at
the report-level permission check before either report could run.

## Why not restore `Stock User` or `Accounts Manager`

Restoring `Stock User` would be too broad for the finance role. In candidate,
`Stock User` grants create/write/submit/cancel/delete/amend on `Stock Entry`.
`Accounts Manager` similarly carries accounting mutation authority on invoice
documents. Both conflict with the hardening decision that Matt should have broad
finance/audit visibility without operational mutation rights.

## Implemented fix

Added migration patch:

```text
inductone_tools.patches.v2026_06_29_finance_stock_report_access
```

The patch idempotently appends `Finance Viewer` to the Report role rows for a
curated set of business/audit reports covering inventory valuation, stock
ledger review, sales/purchase registers, and accounting ledgers. It deliberately
does not grant admin diagnostics, manufacturing planning, or operational action
reports.

This fixes the missing report gate without granting Matt stock or accounting
write authority.

## Candidate validation

Candidate sandbox:

```text
inductone-candidate.localhost
```

Evidence:

```text
C:\hub\frappe-sandbox\validation-evidence\finance_business_report_access_hotfix_20260629.json
```

Result:

- Curated Finance Viewer business/audit report set: `Finance Viewer` present on
  Report role table; candidate Finance Viewer persona permitted.
- Focused hotfix evidence summary: 30/30 curated reports passed.

The full production post-deploy validator was also extended to include these two
report access checks. Running that full validator against candidate produced an
expected unrelated candidate-only failure on `super_profile_absence`, because
this restored candidate database still contains users with the old `Super` Role
Profile. The new report checks themselves passed.

## Production deployment note

This hotfix should be deployed through the normal app update + `bench migrate`
path. The production post-deploy validator should then be run with:

```bash
--finance-report-user "matt.speer@plusonerobotics.com"
```

Expected post-hotfix production validator result is 8/8 passed.
